A Basic custom SA:MP Launcher
=============
This program shows the basics of a custom SA-MP launcher, considering this problem comes up on the SA-MP forums frequently, I figured it's time to show how it's done to the people that still do not understand.
As SAMP_AC is no longer requiring a custom SA-MP launcher, I've edited the samp_elevator.exe application from it to be a command line utility instead and open source, to show people how to make a custom launcher

It is important to note, that this SA-MP launcher was tested across many computers, by many people, for many months as it was included in the SA-MP AC binary for months. It has a great track record and worked well for the time it was being used, It was not removed from SAMP_AC due to any problems with it.

Requirements
